# Only macOS


A collection of simple shell utilities and enhancements for macOS. Each folder contains scripts grouped by purpose:

- **Firewall/**  
  Scripts to enable and configure the built-in macOS firewall (Application Firewall and PF rules).

- **compare_directory/**  
  A single script (`compare.sh`) that compares two directory trees and reports any differences.

- **script_create_script/**  
  A helper script (`make_script.sh`) that generates a new Bash script template (with shebang, safety flags, and execute permissions).

- **shortcuts/**  
  This script creates shortcuts on the desktop for specified applications and web links.

- **terminal_plastic_surgery/**  
  Scripts to improve the shell experience: install Homebrew and basic CLI tools, set up a zsh theme, enable auto-completion, and add common aliases.
